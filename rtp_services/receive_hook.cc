/* There are two main ways of getting received RTP frames from uvgRTP.
 * This example demonstrates the usage of hook function to receive RTP frames.
 *
 * The advantage of using a hook function is minimal CPU usage and delay between
 * uvgRTP receiving the frame and application processing the frame. When using
 * the hook method, the application must take care that it is not using the hook
 * function for heavy processing since this may block RTP frame reception.
 *
 * Hook based frame reception is generally recommended for most serious applications,
 * but there can be situations where polling method is better, especially if performance
 * is not a huge concern or if there needs to be tight control when the frame is
 * received by the application.
 *
 * This example only implements the receiving, but it can be used together with the
 * sending example to test the functionality.
